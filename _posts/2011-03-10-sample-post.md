### ARGUMENT

While Thebes was under the rule of <span class="smcap">Laïus</span> and <span class="smcap">Jocasta</span> there appeared a strange and monstrous creature, "the riddling Sphinx," "the She-Wolf of the woven song," who in some unexplained way sang riddles of death and slew the people of Thebes. <span class="smcap">Laïus</span> went to ask aid of the oracle of Delphi, but was slain mysteriously on the road. Soon afterwards there came to Thebes a young Prince of Corinth, <span class="smcap">Oedipus</span>, who had left his home and was wandering. He faced the Sphinx and read her riddle, whereupon she flung herself from her rock and died. The throne being vacant was offered to <span class="smcap">Oedipus</span>, and with it the hand of the Queen, <span class="smcap">Jocasta</span>.

Some ten or twelve years afterwards a pestilence has fallen on Thebes. At this point the play begins.

_The date of the first production of the play is not known, but was probably about the year 425 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>_

## OEDIPUS, KING OF THEBES

<span class="smcap">Scene.</span>—_Before the Palace of <span class="smcap">Oedipus</span> at Thebes. A crowd of suppliants of all ages are waiting by the altar in front and on the steps of the Palace; among them the <span class="smcap">Priest of Zeus</span>. As the Palace door opens and <span class="smcap">Oedipus</span> comes out all the suppliants with a cry move towards him in attitudes of prayer, holding out their olive branches, and then become still again as he speaks._
