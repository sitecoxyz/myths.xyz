<p class="tei tei-p c3">Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit <a class="tei tei-xref" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate</a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: <a class="tei tei-xref" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a">http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate</a></p>

<h2 class="tei tei-head c33" id="pgepubid00038"><span class="c32">General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p c3"><span class="tei tei-name">Professor Michael S. Hart</span> is the originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Corrected <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c12">editions</span></em> of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="c12">Versions</span></em> based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility: <a class="block tei tei-xref c30" tag="{http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}a"><span class="c16">http://www.gutenberg.org</span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p c3">This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg™, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
